# SSL general security improvements should be moved in global settings

# Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) was created as an alternative to the Certificate Revocation List (CRL) protocol. Both protocols are used to check whether an SSL Certificate has been revoked.
# The CRL protocol requires the browser to download potentially large amounts of SSL Certificate revocation information: certificate serial numbers and status of each certificate’s last publication date. The problem with the CRL protocol is that it can increase the time spent completing the SSL negotiation.
# The OCSP protocol does not require the browser to spend time downloading and then searching a list for certificate information. With OCSP, the browser simply posts a query and receives a response from an OCSP responder (a CA’s server that specifically listens for and responds to OCSP requests) about the revocation status of a certificate.
